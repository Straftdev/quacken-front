  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Please keep in mind, this is only a game. As such, the following rules are
    meant mainly as guidelines to keep the environment friendly and welcoming.
    As long as you are not actively trying to ruin someone's day, you will most
    likely be alright. The punishments for the (hopefully) rare offenses severe
    enough to demand Further action include temporary bans and global mute. You
    will never be permanently banned.
  </p>

  <h2>Policies</h2>

  <h4>Annoying People</h4>
  <p>
    You are provided with several commands to deal with the people you wish
    would just go away. /mute &lt;name&gt; is the most basic which will simply
    hide all messages from the targeted account. /kick is used to eject the targeted
    player from any lobbies you own and prevent them from re entering until you
    /pardon them. Used together, the offending player will effectively be "gone".
  </p>
  <p>
    Considering the options, it should be easy to see why being annoying is not
    a crime in itself. If, however, you witness or are targeted by something that
    ignoring is not an option, you are advised to contact a moderator who will
    be able to review the situation and determine if further action is appropriate.
  </p>

  <h4>Botting</h4>
  <p>
    If you think it is fun to tell a computer to play the game for you, go for it!
    The only thing we ask is that you turn "bot mode" on in your user settings
    when you bot to skip statistic counting. This keeps the competitive scene "clean",
    though if there is demand, we may include separate statistics for bots so you
    can compete there instead. <strong>Failure to enable bot mode may lead to your
    statistics being erased.</strong>
  </p>

  <h4>Real Money Trades</h4>
  <p>
    We do not provide ANY insurance or tools to assist in trades that
    extend beyond the boundaries of the game. Trade <strong>at your own risk</strong>.
    That being said, we will not punish you for doing so. It is entirely at your own discretion.
