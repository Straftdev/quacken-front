<h1>Capture the flag!</h1>
<p>This game mode has two main variations. Either take the flags back to your spawn zone, or plant them in the enemy
  base.
</p>

<h3>The flags</h3>
<p>The flags here work different than blockade flags. You pick them up by driving over them and drop them by using the
  flag maneuver. 1 point flags have to be dropped in the 8 tiles surrounding a beacon (3 point flag) matching
  your team color to earn points for your team. 2 point flags need to be taken back to your spawn zone. 3 point
  flags cannot be picked up.
