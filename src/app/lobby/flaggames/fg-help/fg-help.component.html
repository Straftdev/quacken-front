  <p>This game mode has two main variations. Either take the flags back to your spawn zone, or to your base to defend.
  </p>

  <h3>The flags</h3>
  <p>The flags here work different than blockade flags. You pick them up by driving over them and drop them by using the
    flag maneuver. 1 point flags have to be dropped in the 8 tiles surrounding a beacon (3 point flag) matching
    your team color to earn points. 2 point flags need to be taken back to your spawn zone. 3 point
    flags cannot be picked up.
  </p>

  <h3>New Boats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healer</strong> - Healing shot, heal self.</li>
    <li><strong>Sniper</strong> - Long shot, double forward.</li>
    <li><strong>Bomber</strong> - Place bomb, torpedo.</li>
    <li><strong>Builder</strong> - Place rock, in-place turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>New Maneuvers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Healing shot - Heals 25% (50% golden)</li>
    <li>Heal self - Heals 25% (50% golden)</li>
    <li>Place rock - Places a short rock on an empty tile next to the boat. Golden can drop on a wind as well. If you
      hit
      a boat, it sinks instantly.</li>
    <li>Place bomb - Place a bomb similar to kraken hunt, but it moves with winds and whirls. Deals 50% damage (75%
      golden).
    </li>
    <li>Torpedo - Fires a torpedo from the front of your ship which travels 2 tiles and removes short rocks in a 3x3
      area.
      It will also clear other objects in this area and damage boats based on how close they are to the center. Golden
      deals more damage.</li>
    <li>Long shot - Travels up to 4 tiles and deals 50% damage (75% golden).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Extra Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respawn 2pt Flags</strong> - When a 2 point flag is taken home, should it respawn back at its starting
      point or vanish?</li>
    <li><strong>Stealable flags on sink</strong> - If enabled, a carried flag drops without a team when you sink. The
      first team to touch it again can then claim it for points. This only matters for 2 point flags as 1 point flags
      are
      already free for all.</li>
  </ul>
